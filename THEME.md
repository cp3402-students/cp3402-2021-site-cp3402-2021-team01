<h1>Underscores</h1><br>
The underscores starter theme was used to initialize work on the theme as it provided boilerplate code that was considered to be useful.
<br><br>
<strong>Sass</strong><br>
We decided to use Sass in our project because it was an easier, more organised alternative to createing our own styles sheets. With the use of the built in File Watcher in PHPStrom it was able to automatically compile the main styles.css file for us with ease.
<br><br>
<strong>Header & Footer</strong><br>
The header.php file was edited to enable the implementation of a menu using the UI in the “customize” page on word press, meaning all changes to the menu can be done through customize. This process was also done for the option of a logo in the header and a header image above the header. The functions.php file was also used in the allowing of a custom logo in the header, in functions.php the size was defined to be 250 x 250, as this was deemed an acceptable size by the group as it is the same size as the logo image provided. The _header.scss file was updated to alter the colour of the header to a dark blue. The _header-menu.scss is used to define the colours and sizing of the menu in the header.
<br><br>
<strong>Colours</strong><br>
Dark blue was chosen for the header colour as the team believed it concentrated well with the white site background and also maintained a low profile, professional look for the website. A charchoal colour was chosen for the main body text so that it does not not overpower the other colours of the theme, create a strong contrast between the text and white background and make it easier for viewer to read.  To change the main colours of the site the _colours.scss is used.
<br><br>
<strong>Typography</strong><br>
The _typography.scss file was used to define the fonts of the text used in the header and the body text. PT serif and Source Sans Pro were used as they provide a professional feel to the website and are easy to read fonts.
